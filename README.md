# Personalized-recommendation-systems
Machine learning techniques play a key role to extract individual preference over items.  In this project,I explore this popular business application of machine learning,by implementing a simple matrix-factorization-based recommender using gradient descent and data from Netflix, which is  a  set  of  ratings  (from  one  star  to  five  stars)from users on many movies they have seen.  Using this information, your job is implementing a personalized rating predictor for a given user on unseen movies.  That is,  a rating predictor can be seen as a functionf:U ×I →R,  whereUandIare  the  set  of  users  and  items,  respectively.
